    "Arrays are cool and super useful, but for certain use cases (like tabular data analysis, ETL operations, database interfacing, etc.), they just don't really cut it. In Julia, users can use DataFrames.jl to gain access to a very capable, high-performance table implementation. DataFrames is very well-tuned and even automatically multithreads many operations. If your data is small enough to fit on a single worker and in-memory, the DataFrame is a great option!"

    "Dagger is a powerful toolkit for parallel programming, with a variety of useful APIs for doing useful computations and analyses, and which integrate nicely with Julia's large and growing ecosystem. However, there are definitely some areas that are a work in progress that I wanted to mention before we wrap up:\n",
    "- The `DArray` is missing some useful operators, particularly support code for combinations with e.g. DataFrames\n",
    "- Dagger typically uses more memory than hand-rolled solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are on the Todo list for the next few months, and should be significantly improved as more contributions to Dagger and friends are made by maintainers and contributors."
